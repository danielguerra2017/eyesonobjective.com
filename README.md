Contained within are the files that make up the Eyes On Objective website. This website is home to regular tournaments and continues to expand/grow. I am constantly adding new features and information to promote the growth of the website and to help challenge myself to accomplish new things. With this website, I help give life to the ideas of the people that run the tournament through the use of HTML, CSS, and PHP.
